<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
2nd Microverse solo project.

### Objective
 1. Understanding what a Framework is in CSS.
 2. Use Bootstrap to complete this project.
 
### Assignment:
 

   1. Go to ![this website](https://www.newsweek.com/) and have a look around.
   2. Create a blank HTML document.
   3. Add Bootstrap to your project by following the instructions at GetBootstrap.com. Use the examples on that page as templates for how to organize your page.
   4. Lay out the empty semantic HTML elements for the major sections (form, sidebar, footer…) and make them  	 the proper size and alignment. 
   5. Work your way down the page by filling in and positioning the additional sections.
   7. Try resizing the browser to see if it mimics the behavior of the real Newsweek homepage.
   8. Push your solution to Github.

### Built With
This project was built using raw html, css and some javascript. Also uses Bootstrapt 4 and FontAwesome.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Use

It's not a dynamic website, just a static one. So there is no use involved. Should not break horribly when resizing.
